npm vue-cli based sample project created named rent. I am using vuecli purely to run localhost server. Code is written in vanilla Javascript.
In components, molecules are building blocks and partials are pages. Header.vue and Footer.vue contains template/CSS/JavaScript for the components.
App.vue contains base template with router-view injecting partials to build the pages.
home.vue partial is holding content area between Header and Footer. it contains template/CSS/JavaScript for the main content area.
